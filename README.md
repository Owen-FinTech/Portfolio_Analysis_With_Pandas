# Module_4_Challenge: Portfolio Analysis With Pandas

This repo contains a notebook file and a folder of supplementary files. They document performance analysis, risk analysis, rolling statistics and visualizations to determine if various portfolios outperform the market. 

## Technologies

The main Jupyter Notebook file, scripted in Python, relies heavily on the Pandas software library. The data used for analysis is read-in with the Pathlib module using .csv files. Some of the .csv files were downloaded from Google Sheets and prepared using its built-in Google Finance function.
